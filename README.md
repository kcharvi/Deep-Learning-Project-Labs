# Deep-Learning-Project-Labs

> **Lab 1** : Deals with basics of python coding using pytorch to create simple tensors. Also brushes up the concept of Gradient Decent

> **Lab 2** : Introduction to Keras Classifier and building a sequential model beginning with a structured dataset.

> **Lab 3** : Beginning with Computer Vision basics to seperate channels, color spaces, drawing shapes, and applying various morphological and geometrical operations. Applying smoothing techniques and image segmentations or thresholding techniques like OTSU and adaptive thresholding. Understanding histogram equalization and improving clarity of an image. Along with canny edge detection and image contours. Finally! Face Detection using HAAR Cascade Classifier.

> **Lab 4** : This lab has two projects: i) Facial Emotion Detection with Computer Vision as well as Deep Learning model \n ii) Road Lane Detection using cv2 techniques and DL modelling

> **Lab 5** : Understanding different hyperparameter tuning: Dropouts, Padding, Keras Tuner, Data Augmentation techniques. Performing transfer learning with VGG, Resnet and training Non Dense layers on flowers classification dataset. Using Tensorflow Hub to extract models EfficentNet and InceptionNet on 102 Oxford FLowers Dataset

> **Lab 6** : This lab introduces StreamLit Applications for the deployment of deep learning models as a Web based Application. My application contains flowers classification, 315 different Bird species indentification and facial features detection along with several enhancing types.

> **Lab 7** : Getting introduced to You Only Look Once(YOLO) Object Detection using Live Video input and real time detection from WebCam, utilizing the DarkNet Yolov4 version to implement. Load your configuration files from the official website to proceed with the codes.

> **Lab 8** : Custom Object detection using Yolov5. Detection object used by me - Bear | Dataset taken from - google apis OpenImageDatasets.

> **Lab 9** : Learn Deep Fakes: Face Sapping with two images and deepfake video on an image.

> **Lab 10** : Introduction to Mobile application using flutter DART programming to understand the structure of widgets and simple static implementation of a self profile page. This lab is to get familiar with flutter app which will be used in the next two labs for deploying Deep Learning Models.

> **Lab 11** : Deploying Deep Learning Model in Flutter Application: This project has brain tumor classification with four different classes: glioma, meningioma, pitutory and no tumor. Usage of TFLite for importing the heavy models to run on your mobile, gives a deeper understanding on how to build flutter apps as well.

> **Lab 12** : Using Deep Learning API calls to build a Neural Style Transfer application using flutter, extending your User Interface from basic to intermediate features from the previous labs. Make sure to give in your api-key from RapidAPI utilities.

> **Lab 13** : Implementing Research Paper architectures to equip you with completing understanding with a researchers mindset. We implement End TO End Memory Networks proposed in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08895.pdf
> The outcome is to understand building vocabulary/corpus, vectorization, and implementing encoders and decoders in the process of model building.
